The DragonSpark Multiversal Application Framework
=================================================

The DragonSpark Multiversal Application Framework is an application development accelerator for Xaml-based application services and clients.

This framework is a work-in-progress that stretches almost a decade, and features the best (personal) coding practices and patterns that I have found during that time.

That is not to say that I am some expert by any means.  The more I learn in life, the more I realize I have to learn.  This is especially so in software.

Originally, this project started out as an ASP.NET framework, then got ported to Silverlight, then to HTML5, and now Xamarin and Urho3D.

This is still very much a work in progress.  Please excuse the mess.

As reference, an older, deployed featureset application built in HTML5 hosted on Windows Azure may be found here:
