The DragonSpark Framework
=================================================
A Blazor-based Application Development Framework

I originally intended this to be a framework that I would promote and get others to adopt, but after seeing the amount of work in doing so (particularly involved in "wrangling cats" around open source efforts), I have made this more about having a codebase that I maintain online and if others want to view it, fine.  And if not, fine as well.

So welcome to my framework.  I've been working on it for over a decade, and hope to continue doing so for many more decades.

## Applications

I currently have only one application built with this puppy, and you can follow along here, if interested:
