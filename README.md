The DragonSpark Multiversal Application Framework
=================================================

The DragonSpark Multiversal Application Framework is an application development accelerator for Xaml-based application services and clients.

This framework is a work-in-progress that stretches almost a decade, and features the best coding practices and patterns that I have found during that time.

Originally, this project started out as an ASP.NET framework, then got ported to Silverlight, then to HTML5, and now Xamarin.Forms.

This is still very much a work in progress.  Please excuse the mess. 

**insert 90's internets construction guy here**

As mentioned, this codebase is being moved to Xamarin.Forms.  For starters, this project will feature a WPF Renderer that is based on a heavily modified and adapted Windows Phone Renderer that currently exists in Xamarin.Forms 1.3.x.

From there, it is off to the Feature-Set application.

As reference, an older deployed featureset application built in HTML5 hosted on Windows Azure may be found here:

#### Feature-Set Application
The DragonSpark Multiversal Application Framework addresses these key application and system development friction points:
- Application Initialization
- Application Configuration (Xaml-Driven IoC and WebApi Controller Configuration)
- Proxy-based REST Service Calls
- Operation Management and User Experience
- Exception Handling, Reporting and User Experience
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Navigation
