The DragonSpark Multiversal Application Framework
=================================================

The DragonSpark Multiversal Application Framework is an application development accelerator for Xaml-based application services and application clients.

This framework is a work of progress that stretches almost a decade, and features the best coding practices and patterns I have found during that time.

Originally, this project started out as an ASP.NET framework, then got ported to Silverlight, then to HTML5, and now Xamarin.Forms.

This is still very much a work in progress.  Please excuse the mess.

As mentioned, this codebase is being moved to Xamarin.Forms.  For starters, I am creating a WPF Renderer based on the Windows Phone Renderer that currently exists in Xamarin.Forms 1.3.x.

From there, it is off to the Feature-Set application.

As reference, an older deployed featureset application built in HTML5 hosted on Windows Azure may be found here:
